    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>When analyzing algorithms, we often consider both their <b>time complexity</b> and <b>space complexity</b>. Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run as the input size increases. An algorithm is considered more efficient if it has a lower time complexity, meaning it performs tasks quickly even with larger datasets.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, <b>space complexity</b> is concerned with the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It's often denoted using big O notation, such as <b>O(n)</b>, where <b>n</b> represents the input size. Space complexity is important because limited memory resources can impact the performance of an algorithm. By optimizing space complexity, we can ensure that an algorithm uses memory efficiently and avoids excessive memory consumption.</p>
